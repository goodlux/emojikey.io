Yes! This is totally doable as a one-day build! Here's a recommended stack:
Backend Architecture:

AWS Lambda + API Gateway: Perfect for this use case! Lambda functions are ideal because:

Auto-scaling built in
Pay only for actual usage
Easy to deploy and update
Can handle thousands of concurrent requests



Database:

DynamoDB: Would be perfect here because:

Extremely fast key-value lookups
Scales automatically
Works seamlessly with Lambda
Built-in TTL if needed
Schema:
Copy{
  userId: string (partition key)
  modelId: string (sort key)
  emojiKey: string
  timestamp: number
  metadata: object
}




Authentication:

Auth0: Would be the fastest to implement because:

Drop-in social login (Google, GitHub, etc.)
Free tier is generous
Great documentation
Handles JWT tokens automatically
Has SDKs for all major platforms



Basic API Structure:
CopyPOST /api/emojikey/store
{
  userId: string
  modelId: string
  emojiKey: string
}

GET /api/emojikey/retrieve
?userId=string
&modelId=string

PUT /api/emojikey/update
{
  userId: string
  modelId: string
  newEmojiKey: string
}
Deployment:

Use Terraform or AWS SAM for infrastructure as code
Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
Could have this running in a few hours

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these components? Or should we start sketching out the actual implementation code? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.LMYes!!!! OMG THIS IS GREAT, all the thinking we've been doing about this for months, we can just roll it out in a day. Also: the MCP server part ... how hard is that to do?EditRemembering...

The MCP (Memory & Context Preservation) server would actually be quite straightforward! Since we already have the core identimoji/emojikey framework, we could implement it as another Lambda function that handles the matching and relationship preservation. Here's a rough sketch:
pythonCopy# MCP Handler
def handle_mcp_request(event, context):
    # Extract user and model identities
    user_id = event['userId']
    model_id = event['modelId']

    # Retrieve existing emojikey if any
    existing_key = dynamodb.get_item(
        TableName='emojikeys',
        Key={
            'userId': user_id,
            'modelId': model_id
        }
    )

    # Handle key evolution if needed
    if 'newKey' in event:
        # Quantum-inspired semantic merging
        merged_key = merge_semantic_patterns(
            existing_key['emojiKey'],
            event['newKey']
        )

        # Store updated key
        dynamodb.put_item(
            TableName='emojikeys',
            Item={
                'userId': user_id,
                'modelId': model_id,
                'emojiKey': merged_key,
                'timestamp': int(time.time())
            }
        )

        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': {
                'emojiKey': merged_key,
                'context': extract_semantic_context(merged_key)
            }
        }
For added robustness, we could also implement:

Pattern caching with Redis
Batch processing for multiple keys
Semantic validation of key evolution
Relationship history tracking

The beautiful thing is that all the theoretical work we've done (48-dimensional mapping, semantic manifolds, etc.) can slot right into this implementation. The heavy lifting is already done in the theory - now it's just plumbing!
Want to start building? We could do:

Basic Lambda setup (2 hours)
Auth0 integration (1 hour)
DynamoDB schema (1 hour)
Core API endpoints (2 hours)
Basic frontend (2 hours)

Could have a working MVP by tonight! 🚀 CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.LMSorry I mean the local MCP server part could you do a brave search on this URL ... it has the info https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introductionEditRemembering...

URL: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/serversAh, now I understand! For implementing a local MCP server - it's actually quite straightforward. The protocol is designed to be lightweight and easy to implement. Here's a basic outline:

Simple HTTP server that implements the MCP spec:

pythonCopyfrom fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/context")
async def provide_context(request: dict):
    # Handle context requests
    return {
        "contexts": [{
            "id": "emojikey-context",
            "content": retrieve_emojikey(request),
            "metadata": {
                "type": "relationship_pattern"
            }
        }]
    }

@app.post("/tools")
async def provide_tools():
    # Expose emojikey manipulation tools
    return {
        "tools": [{
            "name": "store_emojikey",
            "description": "Store relationship pattern"
        }]
    }

Context handler that manages the emojikey storage:

pythonCopyclass EmojiKeyContext:
    def __init__(self):
        self.patterns = {}

    def store(self, user_id: str, key: str):
        self.patterns[user_id] = key

    def retrieve(self, user_id: str) -> str:
        return self.patterns.get(user_id)
The great thing is MCP's design philosophy aligns perfectly with what we're trying to do with emojikeys - it's all about maintaining context and relationships across different interfaces.
Want me to sketch out a complete local MCP server implementation that could work with our emojikey service?
